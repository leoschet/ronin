# Ronin
Rogue assistant that follows its own path, with no lord or master.

## Setup

- Create a new Python environment.
  - Check the version requirements in [pyproject.toml](./app/backend/pyproject.toml).
- This project uses poetry for dependency management. Install it with `pip install poetry`.
- By default, this project uses `ruff` for linting and code formatting.
  - For some reason, `ruff` doesn't work with poetry, so install it with `pip install ruff`.
